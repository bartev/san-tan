- execute with "C-x C-e"

* More Complex Functions

** example exercises
Write an interactive function with an optional argument that tests
whether its argument, a number, is greater than or equal to, or else,
less than the value of ‘fill-column’, and tells you which, in a message.
However, if you do not pass an argument to the function, use 56 as a
default value.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun gt-fill? (&optional val)
  (let* ((check-val (or val 56))
         (is-ge? (> check-val fill-column))
         (res (if is-ge? "greater" "less")))
    (message "%d is %s than fill-column (%d)" check-val res fill-column)))

(gt-fill? 25)
(gt-fill? 85)
