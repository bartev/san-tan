Random text for example
Together with actions, transformations contribute to a Spark query 
plan (we will cover query plans in next chapter), but nothing is 
executed until an action is invoked. For example, the below, Example 
2-1, has two transformations (read() and filter()) and one action 
(count()) as follows:

Python Example 2-1

>>> strings = spark.read.text("README.md") 
          >>> filtered = strings.filter(strings.value.contains("Spark"))
          >>> filtered.count()
          20
By contrast, an action triggers the execution of all transformations 
recorded as part of the query execution plan (see chapter 3 for 
query execution plan). In this example above nothing happens until 
filtered.count() is executed in the shell.
